      title="Africanisation"
      >
      <p>We are proud that since 2001 all ICRHS programmes were completely managed by Africans. All project managers, supervisors, trainers, field teams and community staff are African. While these teams provide learning opportunities for intern and volunteer partnerships, the Africanisation of all projects has been a vital component of the success and continuity of the programmes.

      >
      <p>
        ICRHS is an equal opportunity employer. As part of our Gender policy, we have actively recruited women into senior management positions. The majority of project managers and field coordinators are women, and the great majority of field staff are women. ICRHS focuses all its core programme development on gender.

      title="Whose Reality"
      >
        <p>As part of corporate accountability ICRHS places the beliefs, values, cultural structures and hopes of the local people at the centre of planning, decision making and planning. With a strong inclusion policy and partnership in local language, we work towards programmes that have their roots in local communities.</p>

      title="Transparency"
      >    
      <p>As part of our policy of accountability to our donors ICRHS continually strives to improve its financial systems and procedures. With rural projects scattered across geographical areas larger than Ireland, there are challenges to ensure best practices and accountability of resources in Africa. ICRHS and our donors undertake frequent internal and external audits with annual external audits of all programmes.</p>
      <p>As part of continual improvements and strengthening of the organization, we conducted external organization and management reviews and have recently commissioned Ernst and Young to carry out a comprehensive financial review of all financial systems, structures procedures and operations. Our commitment is to best practices of transparency and collective accountability. ICRHS insists on the highest standards from its entire staff as well as ensuring due diligence and the highest work ethics. Our code of conduct is based upon international gold standards and ensures not only equality and ethics, but transparency and integrity.</p>
      <p>We are currently extending the Global fund accounting system into all new programmes being implemented.</p>
      <p>External audits and comprehensive financial records are available to partners including Governments through our national offices.</p>
